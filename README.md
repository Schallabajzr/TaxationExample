# Instructions for testing

## In dev mode

> **_NOTE:_** Requires Docker and Maven

First start the database with the follwoing command

```shell script
docker run --ulimit memlock=-1:-1 -it --rm=true --memory-swappiness=0 --name quarkus -e POSTGRES_USER=quarkus -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=quarkus -e POSTGRES_DB=quarkus -p 5432:5432 postgres:13
```

> **_NOTE:_** you don't need Postgresql for integration and unit tests - they start up a H2 database and close it after the tests finish

then start the quarkus application with the following command (note it is a backslash on Windows)

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

you can visit http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui and call the REST services from there

## In prod mode

Use docker compose to start building a native image
> **_NOTE:_** this takes about 15 minutes to download the images, test and build the application, for all future builds it is almost instantaneous (couple of seconds for Postgresql and less than 0.1sec for Quarkus to be ready to accept connections)

```shell script
docker-compose up --build -d
```

It will also start a Postgresql database and populate it with some test data, which can also be tested
on http://localhost:8080/q/swagger-ui .
> **_NOTE:_** Postgresql sometimes gets stuck initialising the database because it hangs in the import.sql script in that case delete the volume or drop everything in the public schema

## Additional information

The /trade endpoint is meant to calculate the tax for a given bet and /trader is there for testing purposes and is not
tested with integration and unit tests.

There is additional information generated by Quarkus below and should be referenced as needed.

# code-with-quarkus project

This project uses Quarkus, the Supersonic Subatomic Java Framework.

## Running the application in dev mode

You can run your application in dev mode that enables live coding using:

```shell script
./mvnw compile quarkus:dev
```

> **_NOTE:_**  Quarkus now ships with a Dev UI, which is available in dev mode only at http://localhost:8080/q/dev/.

## Packaging and running the application

The application can be packaged using:

```shell script
./mvnw package
```

It produces the `quarkus-run.jar` file in the `target/quarkus-app/` directory. Be aware that it’s not an _über-jar_ as
the dependencies are copied into the `target/quarkus-app/lib/` directory.

If you want to build an _über-jar_, execute the following command:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Dquarkus.package.type=uber-jar
```

The application is now runnable using `java -jar target/quarkus-app/quarkus-run.jar`.

## Creating a native executable

You can create a native executable using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative
```

Or, if you don't have GraalVM installed, you can run the native executable build in a container using:

```shell script
./mvnw package -Pnative -Dquarkus.native.container-build=true
```

You can then execute your native executable with: `./target/code-with-quarkus-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT-runner`

If you want to learn more about building native executables, please consult https://quarkus.io/guides/maven-tooling.html
